# NBN File Organiser
This was a WPF C# app that i made to organise multiple files with the same discription into a single folder.
This was used with NBN, Where multiple photos were taken of a NBN pit and added to a single directory
I Purely made this due to our NBN divison only using dropbox, which had an awful mobile app
This was made so i could throw all the photos into the same directory and it would auto organise the photos
